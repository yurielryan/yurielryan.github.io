This project involved implementing and training Google's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07486" target="_blank">Guided Speech Enhancement Network (GSE Network)</a> using PyTorch on Google Cloud Platform. The goal was to denoise and enhance local Singaporean English speech. We curated a dataset from IMDA's <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/national-speech-corpus" target="_blank">National Speech Corpus</a>, focusing on beamformed waveforms for realistic training and evaluation. The resulting model demonstrated significant improvements in speech clarity and noise reduction, tailored for Singaporean accents.
