![Overall Framework](<../images/Tiktok Solution Architecture.png>)

**Task:** Answer questions of various forms (MCQ, open-ended, correctly-led and wrongly-led) about short-form videos.

**Result:** 

Correctness Score: **58.07% (ANT)**, 45.2% (GPT4o)

Robustness Score: **15.3% (ANT)**, 8% (GPT4o)

**Core Ideas:**
1.  **Rich Context Augmentation:** We gather extensive metadata associated with each YouTube video, including title, description, channel information, keywords, **captions (transcripts)**, and critically, **user comments**. Comments often contain discussions, clarifications, or reveal audience perception, which can be vital clues (e.g., users pointing out a video is reversed).
2.  **Video Pre-processing (Slowing Down):** Recognising that models like Google Gemini process video at a fixed rate (e.g., 1 frame per second), we slow down the input videos (to 0.5x speed). Our intuition is that this allows the model to observe finer-grained temporal details within its fixed sampling rate, potentially making subtle motion patterns (like unnatural reversals) more apparent.
3.  **Structured Prompt Engineering:** We use Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 model with a carefully crafted prompt (`v3`). This prompt explicitly asks the model to:
    *   Describe the video's start, middle, and end segments.
    *   Detail its reasoning process step-by-step (`THINKING STEPS`).
    *   Provide a final answer (`FINAL ANSWER`).
    This structured approach encourages more thorough analysis before committing to an answer and leverages the rich context gathered in the previous steps.
