Hi! My name is Yuriel (or Ryan if your prefer) and I am a M.Eng student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, kindly supported by the [AI Singapore Accelerated Masters Program](https://aisingapore.org/research/ai-amp/) and the [DSO-AISG Research Award](https://aisingapore.org/research/dso-aisg-research-awards/). I go by "Yuriel Ryan" in my publications.

Currently, I primarily focus on fundamental Multimodal ML research. My [interests](https://yurielryan.github.io/research/) lie in developing **systematic approaches to represent emergent knowledge/phenomena** through three directions: **comprehending emergent ideas**, such as culture or humor; **analyzing emergent attributes** such as data quality or biases; and **managing emergent behaviors/properties** such as hallucinations and robustness. This means using theoretical frameworks, such as those from information theory, to construct my hypotheses and experiments. 

I try my best to aim for more rigorous "good science" to achieve actionable findings instead of chasing whatever that is popular in the AI space---this seems to change every couple of weeks anyways. If this research philosophy resonates with you, let's work on something together! :)
