Work Experience
======


### Founding AI Engineer, Pallo (formerly Check) (Iterative W25)
2025 January – March
- Built a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow to produce syllabus-accurate outputs, securing a Pre-Seed fund from Iterative VC (Winter 2025).
- Built a data processing pipeline by combining open-source Computer Vision models with LLMs, contributing 8,700 high quality questions to Supabase for RAG.
- Deployed DeepSeek R1 models to Google Cloud Run to solve Singapore GCE A-Level math problems, increasing the accuracy of the final outputs by 36%.

### LMM Research Assistant, Social AI Lab (SUTD)
2024 June – December
- Web scraped using Selenium and Beautiful Soup to collect more than 28,000 comics for analysis.
- Recruited and managed 8 participants to evaluate 2,800 comics using Label Studio to assess large multimodal models' (LMMs such as Qwen2-VL, LLaVa-OV, GPT4o and Gemini) ability to comprehend humor.

### LLM Research Intern, DSO National Laboratories
2023 August – December
- Applied the Graph of Thoughts reasoning workflow with LLMs to detect vulnerable code within a 3-layer call stack, reducing incurred API (ChatGPT) costs by 25%.
- Integrated Llama 2 and Code Llama with LangChain to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), further improving contextual understanding.

<!-- ### Undergraduate TA, SUTD
2022 September – December
- Taught small groups (4-5 per group) of students in the 10.014 Computational Thinking for Design module.
- Graded home assignments and lab work (programming a Raspberry Pi microcontroller) and maintained student records.
- Assisted faculty with the preparation of 20 unique questions for upcoming classes that test students on their coding (Python) abilities – search algorithms, functions and object-oriented programming questions. -->

**Technical Skills:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Google Cloud Platform, SQL, Java
